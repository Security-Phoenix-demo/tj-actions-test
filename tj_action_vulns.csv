You are using version 0e58ed8671d6b60d0890c21b07f8835ace038e67 which is currently compromised, it is dumping sensitive information, you should remove this immediately to prevent further compromise to your GitHub repositories.
It is recommended to:
1. Remove it from your actions immediately
2. Rotate your credentials where necessary
3. Investigate the secrets in your repositories to see if they were used maliciously
You should search your organization with this rule, but also https://github.com/search?q=org%3A%3CYOURORG%3E+uses%3A+tj-actions%2F&type=code and enter your organization which will help narrow down affected repositories.
Every version of tj-actions is compromised, all tags point to 0e58ed8 which is the compromised PR. Public repos should assume they are compromised.

vulnerable code line,
You are using version v1.1.3 which is currently compromised, it is dumping sensitive information, you should remove this immediately to prevent further compromise to your GitHub repositories.
It is recommended to:
1. Remove it from your actions immediately
2. Rotate your credentials where necessary
3. Investigate the secrets in your repositories to see if they were used maliciously
You should search your organization with this rule, but also https://github.com/search?q=org%3A%3CYOURORG%3E+uses%3A+tj-actions%2F&type=code and enter your organization which will help narrow down affected repositories.
Every version of tj-actions is compromised, all tags point to 0e58ed8 which is the compromised PR. Public repos should assume they are compromised.

You are using version v1.1.3 which is currently compromised, it is dumping sensitive information, you should remove this immediately to prevent further compromise to your GitHub repositories.
It is recommended to:
1. Remove it from your actions immediately
2. Rotate your credentials where necessary
3. Investigate the secrets in your repositories to see if they were used maliciously
You should search your organization with this rule, but also https://github.com/search?q=org%3A%3CYOURORG%3E+uses%3A+tj-actions%2F&type=code and enter your organization which will help narrow down affected repositories.
