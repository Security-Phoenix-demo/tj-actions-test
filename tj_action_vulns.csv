You are using version v35 which is currently compromised, it is dumping sensitive
information, you should remove this immediately to prevent further
compromise to your GitHub repositories.

It is recommended to:

1. Remove it from your actions immediately
2. Rotate your credentials where necessary
3. Investigate the secrets in your repositories to see if they were used maliciously

You should search your organization with this rule, but also https://github.com/search?q=org%3A%3CYOURORG%3E+uses%3A+tj-actions%2F&type=code and enter your organization which will help narrow down affected repositories.
Every version of tj-actions is compromised, all tags point to 0e58ed8 which is the compromised PR. Public repos should assume they are compromised.
It's currently unclear if credentials were also exfiltrated.
